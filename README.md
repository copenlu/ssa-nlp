# Sequential subspace alignment of word embeddings

This repository contains experiments and visualizations for temporal domain adaptation in the form of semi-supervised subspace alignment for word embeddings. It accompanies the paper

"Back to the future -- Sequential alignment of text representations"

which is to be presented at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020 ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03464)).

Natural Language Processing tasks currently tackled:
- annual paper acceptance prediction
- temporal named entity recognition
- rumour stance and veracity prediction.

### Data

Rumour stance data stems from the EU project [PHEME](https://www.pheme.eu/), which revolves around automatically determining the truth value of online statements. Specifically, we're looking at the journalism use case.
