# Sequential Subspace Alignment for NLP

Repository contains code and experiments for temporal domain adaptation in the form of semi-supervised subspace alignment for word embeddings. It accompanies the paper

"Back to the future -- Sequential alignment of text representations"

which is to be presented at the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 2020 ([preprint](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.03464)).

Natural Language Processing tasks currently tackled:
- temporal named entity recognition.
- rumour stance and veracity prediction
- annual paper acceptance prediction
